# Path Planning Algorithm
In this project written in C++ a simplified path planning algorithm is implemented for a robot to move about a simple 2D environment - a rectangular room with obstacles.
A simple 2D environment will be represented as a grid of ASCII characters. 
For example. 
```
==========
=S.......=
========.=
=......=.=
==.=.=...=
=..=..=.==
=.===.=..=
=..==G==.=
===.======
==========
```

`=` Wall
</p>
`.` Path
`S` Start point
`G` Goal point
